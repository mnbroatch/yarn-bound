# What is YarnBound?

[Yarn](https://yarnspinner.dev/) is a language for writing dialogue trees.

YarnBound attempts to be the simplest way to use the Yarn language in the context of a javascript application. It is a wrapper around a specific [forked version of bondage.js](https://github.com/mnbroatch/bondage.js), where effort has been made to comply with the [Yarn 2.0 spec](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/9275277f50a6acbe8438b29596acc8527cf5581a/Documentation/Yarn-Spec.md).

Quality-of-life features on top of bondage.js:
  - A simpler API
  - History of previous Results
  - Option to return text and a subsequent options block together as one result
  - Option to run a custom command handler function instead of returning a CommandResult
  - include an `isDialogueEnd` property with the last Result in a dialogue

A live demo is [on the author's web site](https://matthewbroatch.com/)

Bondage.js also does not support
  - `Character: some text` annotation
  - `[b]Markup[/b]`

because these are not language features (it's confusing). YarnBound adds these things.

The only thing I know to be missing from the spec and non-unity-specific docs is the built-in `wait` command, because I can't tell what I would want it to do.


# Usage

Install with `npm i -S yarn-bound` or grab `yarn-bound.js` from the `/dist/` folder.

For information on how to write Yarn, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/). Start there! YarnBound is useful after you have a yarn dialogue written and in string format. It's worth skimming the [Yarn language spec](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/9275277f50a6acbe8438b29596acc8527cf5581a/Documentation/Yarn-Spec.md) as well.

To get started with YarnBound, import and create a new instance.

```javascript
import YarnBound from 'yarn-bound'
// or node:
// const bondage = require('yarn-bound')
// or in a script tag:
// <script src="path-to-file/yarn-bound.min.js"></script>

const runner = new YarnBound(options)
```

You can then access the first Result with:

```javascript
runner.currentResult
```

To continue the dialogue, call `advance()`.

```javascript
runner.advance()
runner.currentResult // is now the next Result
```

If you were on an Options Result, you would call `advance()` with the index of the desired option.

```javascript
runner.advance(2)
runner.currentResult // is now the Result after the selected option
```

You can also call `jump()` with the `title` of a node to jump directly to that node. This allows for external control over the story flow.

That's all there is to the basic operation!


### Available Options

**dialogue (required)**: *string* - The Yarn dialogue to run. A .yarn file in string form.

**startAt**: *string*: - The title of the node to start the dialogue on.
  - default: "Start"

**functions**: *object* - An object containing custom functions to run when they are called in a yarn expression.
  - As the Yarn docs mention, these should not have side effects. They may execute at unexpected times.
  - You can also use `runner.registerFunction(key, func)` after initialization.

**variableStorage**: *object* - A custom storage object with `get()` and `set()` functions (a `new Map()`, for instance.)
  - Unless you have a specific need you can omit this and use the built-in default.
  - One use is supplying variables with initial values, though you could also do that in the dialogue.

**handleCommand**: *function* - If you provide this, YarnBound will `advance()` right past Command Results, instead calling `handleCommand()` with the Command Result as the single argument (see below for the data structure).

**combineTextAndOptionsResults**: *boolean* - If this is true, a Text Result followed by an Options Result will be combined into one Options Result with a `text` property.
  - This is convenient if you want to show prompts and responses at the same time.

**locale**: *string* - Used for pluralization markdown attributes.


# Results Data

Results, found on `runner.currentResult`, come in three flavors:
  - TextResult
  - OptionsResult
  - CommandResult

You can tell which kind it is by using instanceof

`runner.currentResult instanceof YarnBound.TextResult`

`runner.currentResult instanceof YarnBound.OptionsResult`

`runner.currentResult instanceof YarnBound.CommandResult`

A TextResult looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "text": "This is a line of text.",
  "hashtags": ['someHashtag'],
  "metadata": {/* see below */}
}
```

If it is the last Result in the dialogue, there will also be a `isDialogueEnd` property with the value of `true`.

An Options Result looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "Red",
      "isAvailable": true,
      "hashtags": []
    },
    {
      "text": "Blue",
      "isAvailable": true,
      "hashtags": []
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {/* see below */}
}
```

If `combineTextAndOptionsResults` is enabled, there could be a `text` property on the Options Result. `advance()` from it with an option's index as usual.

A Command Result looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "command": "someCommand",
  "hashtags": [],
  "metadata": {/* see below */}
}
```

It could also have a `isDialogueEnd` property on it (though that may not be useful if you're using a command handler!)

Every Result contains `metadata` which includes node header tags including `title`, and also any file tags.

```javascript
  {
    "title": "StartingNode",
    "someTag": "someTag",
    "filetags": [
      "someFiletag"
    ]
  }
```


### Full example

Let's start with this code:

```javascript
import YarnBound from 'yarn-bound';

// empty lines and uniform leading whitespace is trimmed
// so you can write your nodes in template strings neatly.
const dialogue = `
  title: WhereAreYou
  ---
  Where are you?
  -> Home
    Nice.
    <<doSomething home>>
  -> Work
    Rough.
    <<doSomething work>>
  That's it!
  ===
`

const runner = new YarnBound({
  dialogue,
  startAt: 'WhereAreYou'
})
```

When we log out `runner.currentResult` above, we will get a TextResult with the `text` "Where are you?"

to continue, we call

```javascript
runner.advance()
```

and `runner.currentResult` will be an OptionsResult with an options array with two objects in it. One object's `text` property is "Nice" and one's is "Rough". We will choose "Nice" by calling:

```javascript
runner.advance(0)
```

Now, `runner.currentResult` is a CommandResult where `command` is "doSomething home".

```javascript
runner.advance()
```

One final TextResult, but this time `isDialogueEnd` is `true`.

If `combineTextAndOptionsResults` was true, the first value for `runner.currentResult` would be the same OptionsResult as above, but with a `text` property that says "Where are you?".

If a `handleCommand` function was supplied, it would be called and we would skip straight from the OptionsResult to the last TextResult.

### Minimal full parser

This short script uses YarnBound to implement an interactive command
line user interface for Yarn files.

```
YarnBound = require('yarn-bound');

const yarnData = `
title: start
---
Hello stranger, what brings you into town?
-> What do you do here?
    <<jump do>>
-> Thanks, bye.
    <<jump bye>>

===
title: do
---
Why, I'm the town merchant, of course. Anything you need to buy or sell, you just come talk to me.
-> Got it.
  <<jump start>>

===
title: bye
---
Goodbye then!
<<stop>>
===
`;

const runner = new YarnBound({
  dialogue: yarnData,
  startAt: 'start',
})

let options = false;

process.stdin.on('data', (e) => {
  const input = parseInt(e.toString().substring(0, 1));

  if (options && typeof options[input] !== 'undefined') {
    runner.advance(input);
    loop();
  }
});

const loop = () => {
  const result = runner.currentResult;

  if (result instanceof YarnBound.TextResult){
    console.log(`\n${result.text}`);
    runner.advance();
    setImmediate(loop);
  } else if (result instanceof YarnBound.OptionsResult){
    for (let i = 0; i < result.options.length; i++) {
      if (result.options[i].isAvailable) {
        console.log(`${i} ${result.options[i].text}`);
      }
    }

    options = result.options;
  } else {
    // When the dialogue ends, "result" seems to be undefined. Same when
    // dialogue ends on the <<stop>> command
    process.exit();
  }
};

loop();

```

# Functions

If you are supplying a `functions` object, it would look like this:

```javascript
const runner = new YarnBound({
  dialogue,
  functions: {
    someFunction: (arg) => {/* do stuff */},
    someOtherFunction: (arg1, arg2) => {/* do other stuff */},
  }
})
```


# History

An array containing Results already visited is located at `runner.history`.


# React Component

A simple react component can be found at: [react-dialogue-tree](https://github.com/mnbroatch/react-dialogue-tree)


# Caveats

The `isDialogueEnd` feature assumes your dialogue will terminate on a TextResult, rather than a CommandResult or OptionsResult. The property will be absent if:
  - The dialogue terminates on an OptionsResult, or
  - The dialogue terminates on a CommandResult and a `handleCommand` callback is supplied.
    - Terminating on the `<<stop>>` command is fine


# Other included versions

A minified version exists at `yarn-bound/dist/yarn-bound.min.js`.

If you want to transpile for yourself, use `import YarnBound from 'yarn-bound/src/index'` and make sure your transpiler isn't ignoring it. You will also need to transpile `@mnbroatch/bondage`, and include both in your bundle, if necessary.

A version compatibile with internet explorer is at `yarn-bound/dist/yarn-bound.ie.js`.
